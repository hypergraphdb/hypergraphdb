/**
 * <p>
 * This memory warning system will call all registered listeners when we
 * exceed the percentage of available heap memory specified.  
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * There should only be one instance of this object created, since the
 * usage threshold can only be set to one number. A HyperGraphDB JVM-wide
 * singleton is available statically from {@link HGEnvironment} class. 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>HyperGraph will configure a default usage threshold percentage for
 * the HEAP (i.e. "tenure generation") JVM memory pool to 0.9. This means that
 * listeners will be invoked when used memory reaches about 90% of the maximum
 * available memory. You can change that percentage by calling the
 * <code>setPercentageUsage</code> method and that will globally affect the behavior
 * of all running code. This is an unfortunate design of the JVM - it doesn't
 * allow more than threshold to be configured. It's possible for one to write
 * one's own thread that monitor heap usage, but this begs the question whether
 * the overhead is worth it.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> The goal of this is clearly to reduce memory consumption in caches and the like.
 * Because each listener will shrink memory in an independent way, the result of
 * invoking all of them will perhaps lead to an overzealous cleanup of useful
 * cached information. In the future, it would be a good idea to architect some 
 * sort of cooperation of such cleanup code. Perhaps a desired threshold could be set
 * and each listener invoked iteratively to perform "a little bit of cleanup" as many
 * times as needed to reach that threshold.  
 * </p>
